            Thor: Love and Thunder is a 2022 American superhero 
            film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character 
            Thor, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by 
            Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel
            to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and the 29th film in the 
            Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film is directed
            by Taika Waititi, who co-wrote the script with 
            Jennifer Kaytin Robinson, and stars Chris Hemsworth
            as Thor alongside Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, 
            Jaimie Alexander, Waititi, Russell Crowe, and Natalie
            Portman. In the film, Thor attempts to find inner peace,
            but must return to action and recruit Valkyrie (Thompson),
            Korg (Waititi), and Jane Foster (Portman)—who is now the 
            Mighty Thor—to stop Gorr the God Butcher (Bale) from eliminating all gods.
